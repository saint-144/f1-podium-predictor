# F1 Podium Predictor 🏁

*F1 Podium Predictor** is a fun Next.js + React + Tailwind web app that uses live––and historical––data from the Jolpica (Ergast-compatible) API to predict the top 3 finishers of Formula 1 races.  
It’s built for learning, exploration, and a bit of racing-fan excitement — **not real betting*.
